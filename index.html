            <p>Eli Robert Cope was born on Monday December 17, 2018 at Progress West Hospital.  I will never forget the feeling of having my 5 pound 11 ounce baby boy laying on my cheast.  My husband, Rob, and I were so happy to finally have our son in our arms.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">3 Months</h3>
            <p>The first three months with Eli were filled with up and downs.  Some of the good moments included celebrating our first Christmas as a family of three, welcoming Eli's new cousin, Rhett, and spending lots of time cuddling our sweet smiley boy.  Eli was also working hard on rolling from his back to his belly at this time.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">6 Months</h3>
            <p>Six months, six incredibly fast months.  We celebrated our first Easter, Mother's Day, and Father's Day with our boy.  He mastered rolling and was scooting himself everwhere, especially to his toys.  He was still the happiest little baby.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">9 Months</h3>
            <p>Eli made some huge accomplishments by this time, saying dada, crawling, sitting up, pulling himself up and walking along furniture.  The biggest milestone he hit though, his first steps.  I still remember the feeling of amazement as I watched him take those steps.</p>

            <a name="12months"></a>
            <h3 class="underline">12 Months</h3>
            <p>Twelve months, one year, 365 days, my baby turned one in the blink of an eye.  Eli began walking at 10 months, but at 12 months was still only saying dada.  Eli and I also had a big change between 9 and 12 months, I went back to work as a teacher.  Eli started spending the day with Grandma and Grandpa.</p>

            <h3 class="underline">18 Months</h3>
            <p>A lot changed between 12 and 18 months, I stopped working due to COVID-19 and we started spending a lot more time at home, but Eli didn't let that stop him from growing into a wild and active toddler.  Some of Eli's favorite things were dancing, especailly while watching the "The Price is Right", playing outside, and swimming.  Eli also welcomed another cousing after turning 1, and I began watching him around this time.  Eli was not a fan of sharing his mom or toys.</p>

            <p>Another year older, Eli is officially two years old. He loves to play with all his toys, his favorites are cars and puzzles.  Eli is still very active, but when he slows down he can really focus on a task.  He loves to be in his room looking at books and stacking them.  He also started sleeping in a toddler bed at the end of the summer because he learned how to climb out of his crib.  Rob and I are amazed at how much the tiny baby we brough home from the hospital has changed.  He has grown into the sweetest little boy and we can't wait to see what the next year holds for us.</p>
